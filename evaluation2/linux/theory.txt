                  -------------------------Linux Architecture ---------------------

1. `Hardware Layer`:  
   - Physical components like CPU, memory, and storage.  
   - Linux interacts with this layer via drivers.

2. `Kernel Layer`:  
   - Core of the operating system.  
   - It is responsible for each of the major actions of the Linux OS. 
   - Manages hardware resources, memory, processes, and devices.  
   - Types of kernels:
     - `Monolithic Kernel` (used by Linux): All functions run in one layer.
     - Micro kernels
     - Exo kernels
   
3. `System Call Interface (Shell)`:  
   - Acts as a bridge between applications and the kernel.  
   - Allows programs to request kernel services.

4. `System Libraries`:  
   - Pre-written code that helps applications use OS features.  
   - Example: GNU C Library (glibc) for file management and networking.

5. `User Space (Applications)`:  
   - Programs and utilities run in this layer.  
   - Examples: Text editors, browsers, terminal.

6. `Shell`:  
   - Command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the kernel.  
   - It can take commands through the user and runs the functions of the kernel.
   - Types: Bash, Zsh, etc.

This layered design ensures stability, flexibility, and security.



            ---------------------Linux Shell-------------------

1. `What is a Shell?`  
   - A command-line interface (CLI) 
   that allows users to interact 
   with the Linux operating system.

2. `Types of Shells`:  
   - `Bash (Bourne Again Shell)`: Most common and beginner-friendly.  
   - `Zsh (Z Shell)`: Advanced features and customizations.  
   - `Ksh (Korn Shell)`: For scripting and programming.  
   - `Tcsh/Csh (C Shell)`: Syntax similar to C programming.  

3. `Functions of the Shell`:  
   - Execute commands.  
   - Run shell scripts (automating tasks).  
   - Provide an interface between the user and kernel.

4. `Features`:  
   - Command history.  
   - Tab completion.  
   - Redirection and piping.  
   - Job control (background/foreground processes).  

5. `Examples of Use`:  
   - Navigating files (`cd`, `ls`).  
   - Managing processes (`ps`, `kill`).  
   - File operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`).  

Linux shells are powerful tools 
for interacting with the system efficiently!
