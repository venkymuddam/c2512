I am doing a project LLM model, I will give some description of our project, then please give me all the requirements of our project, not only the software requirements only, I want complete requirements in coding also like which parameters are required in which area(for example in react,python fastapi, rag, Ollama, docker) everything. Like all the requirements in each part in detail and also the details of everything like dependency of each one with other one and when it will continue after getting that dependency or before getting that dependency give each detail in a structural understandable way and give it in a organised way.

Project: First user will enter a his query in react  frontend then query will go the python fastapi by using fastapi calling in react so it is like creating a new entity(POST), so python fastapi will be receiving that query and it will pass it to the another container which will contain RAG database system and Ollama system, do python don't know what happening inside that it will just passing the required information like query to that container so that container will return generated output for the query. And python will return it back to the react so that react will print the generated output along with entered query in the react frontend. Multiple users can query at same time. So the container i mentioned before(RAG, ollama) it contains like rag will store the text message (which is entered in react frontend and goes to RAG through fastAPI call and no chunking is required inside RAG) in it which had some information in that for example it had content like details of all the employees and their login and logout details so if user enter "who are logged in at 5pm" then by using this query it will use RAG and Ollama are used to generate this answer so it goes like that. So python fastapi, rag, Ollama these contained inside the docker. 

So these are some details now give all the requirements in the each step like saparately for react, python fastapi, rag and Ollama system, docker give all details in and out.
