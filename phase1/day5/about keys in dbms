    Key : Unique Identifier 
Super Key 
    a set of one or more columns (attributes) that, 
    taken collectively, 
    allow unique identification of a row in a table
Candidate Key:
    a column, or a set of columns, 
    that can uniquely identify any row 
    in a table.
    Candidate keys are minimal super keys; 
    they contain no extra attributes 
    beyond what is necessary 
    to ensure uniqueness.
Alternate Key
    An alternate key is any candidate key 
    that is not selected as the primary key.

Composite Key can be Candidate Key, Super Key, Alternate Key, 
                     Primary Key, Unique Key, Foreign Key 
    A composite key is a primary key 
    that consists of two or more columns 
    to uniquely identify each row.
Primary Key     -- Constraint 
    A primary key is a unique identifier 
    for each record in a table
    -The primary key cannot contain `NULL` values
Unique Key [Other than the Primary Key, Nullable]   -- Constraint 
    A unique key ensures that all values 
    in a column or set of columns 
    are distinct across row
Secondary Key:  -- Index 
    A secondary key is 
    an attribute or combination of attributes 
    used for data retrieval purposes, 
    not necessarily unique for each record.
