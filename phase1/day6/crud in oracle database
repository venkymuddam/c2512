SQL code for Oracle:

```sql
-- to create the database in Oracle, 
-- we use a schema instead, 
-- as Oracle does not have the CREATE DATABASE command 
-- for user-level operations.

/*
In Oracle 12c and later versions, the error ORA-65096: 
invalid common user or role name occurs 
because Oracle expects common users 
in a multitenant environment (CDB/PDB) 
to have usernames that start with C## 
(for example, C##TRAINER_SEARCH).

```

In Oracle, we use `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` 
for the primary key.

The `CASCADE` option 
in `DROP USER` ensures that all associated objects 
(like tables) are also dropped.
